# Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with the typescript flag. To start up with this project simply follow the steps below;

## Steps

1. clone this project with `git clone <https url>`
2. on sucessful cloning navigate into the project directory and run `npm install` to install all npm packages used in this project.
3. you can then proceed to run `npm start` after step 2 has been successfully done
4. If all the above steps were successful then the app should be running in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Functionalities worked on
The task was to build a clone of Trello in the recommended time of 4 hours. While working on the task I decided to focus primarily on what I consider the core functionalities as listed below:

1. user can create/add as many lists as needed
2. under each list user can create/add as many cards as required
3. user can delete either a list or a card as required
4. user can click on a card to see more information like the name of the card, the description of any and the the list in which the card exists
5. user can also edit the name of the card and the description in the modal showing the card details
6. user can move a card existing on a specific list to any location on another list asides the current list in exist on
7. local storage was implemented to store data

Given the fact that this task is designed to test ability rather than design, my focus was more on functionality given the time constrain.

## Time Spent
I spent a little over 4 hours on this, I believe i spent a maximum of 30 mins extra, it's most likely less than 30 mins though.

## Functionalities I would have worked on if this was to be released to production
If this was to be released to production, a few of the things i would have worked on or added to this would include:

1. a better state management system
2. a little more focus on design beause i'm very particular about the type of design i work on
3. ability to add labels to cards
4. ability to add checklist to cards
5. ability to add members to cards.
